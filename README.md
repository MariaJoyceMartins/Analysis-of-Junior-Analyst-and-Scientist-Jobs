*A data-based analysis of the most requested skills in the Data & Analytics job market*

## 🧭 About this Project

This project was created to help beginners understand which skills matter most when starting a career in **Data Analytics** or **Data Science** — based not on opinion, but on real job market data.

Using recent job postings from **LinkedIn** and **Gupy**, I collected and analyzed **40 junior-level job descriptions**:
- 20 for **Data Analyst Junior** positions (my area of experience)
- 20 for **Data Scientist Junior** or **Data Science Internships**

The goal was to map the technical and soft skills most frequently requested by companies, and from that, suggest a **study roadmap** that makes sense both in terms of priority and learning curve.

## 🔍 Methodology

The analysis followed a simple but structured approach:

- I searched for positions with titles like “Data Analyst”, “BI Analyst”, “Junior Data Scientist” and “Data Science Internship”.
- For each posting, I read the requirements and noted every technical and behavioral skill mentioned.
- I then grouped and counted the frequency of each skill across the 20 openings per role.

This led to two different views:
- 📊 A **skill ranking** for Data Analysts and Data Scientists based on how often they appeared
- 🧠 A **learning order** based on this ranking, plus practical experience or reasoning

## 👀 Why You Might Want to Explore More

By diving into the folders of this repo, you’ll find:

## 📌 Final Note

This is not a definitive guide, but a snapshot of the current market needs based on real data.
It was made to help you study smarter, not harder — and to focus on skills that give real career returns.

Feel free to explore, question, and adapt this to your own journey 🚀
